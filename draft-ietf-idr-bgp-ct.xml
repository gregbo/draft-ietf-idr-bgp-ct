    <abstract>
      <t>This document specifies a mechanism, referred to as "Intent Driven
      Service Mapping", that uses BGP to express intent based association of
      overlay routes, with underlay routes having specific Traffic Engineering
      (TE) characteristics, that satisfy a certain Service Level Agreement
      (SLA). The document achieves this by defining new constructs, to group
      underlay routes with sufficiently similar TE characteristics into
      identifiable classes (called, Transport Classes), that overlay routes
      use as an ordered set to resolve reachability (Resolution Schemes)
      towards service endpoints. These constructs can be used, e.g., to
      realize the "IETF Network Slice" defined in TEAS Network Slices
      framework.</t>

      <t>This document specifies protocol procedures for BGP that enable
      dissemination of service mapping information in a network that may span
      multiple cooperating administrative domains. These domains may be
      administered either by the same provider or by closely coordinating
      providers. A new BGP address family that leverages RFC 4364 procedures
      and follows RFC 8277 NLRI encoding, is defined to advertise underlay
      routes with its identified class. This new address family is called "BGP
      Classful Transport", a.k.a., BGP CT.</t>

    <section title="Introduction">
      <t>Provider networks, typically span across multiple domains where, each
      domain can either represent an Autonomous system (AS) or an Interior
      Gateway Protocol (IGP) region within an AS. In these networks, several
      services are provisioned between different pairs of service endpoints
      (e.g., Provider Edge (PE) nodes), that can either be in the same domain
      or across different domains.</t>

      <t>This document realizes "Intent" as defined in <xref target="RFC9315">
      </xref> and prescribes constructs and procedures that enable provider
      networks to be able to forward service traffic based on service specific
      intent, end-to-end across service endpoints.</t>

      <t>The mechanisms described in this document achieve "Intent Driven
      Service Mapping" between any pair of service endpoints by:<list>
          <t>provisioning end-to-end "intent-aware" paths (e.g., low latency
          path, best effort path) using BGP,</t>

          <t>expressing a desired intent (e.g., use low latency path with
          fallback to the best effort path), and</t>

          <t>forwarding service traffic "only" using end-to-end "intent-aware"
          paths honoring that desired intent.</t>
        </list></t>

      <t>The constructs and procedures defined in this document apply
      homogeneously to intra-AS as well as inter-AS Option A, Option B and
      Option C <xref target="RFC4364"/> Section 10-style deployments in provider
      networks.</t>

      <t>Provider networks that are deployed using such styles, provision
      intra-domain transport tunnels between a pair of endpoints, typically a
      service node or a border node, that service traffic use to traverse that
      domain. These tunnels are signaled using various tunneling protocols
      depending on the forwarding architecture used in the domain, which can
      be Multi Protocol Label Switching (MPLS), Internet Protocol version 4
      (IPv4), or Internet Protocol version 6 (IPv6).</t>

      <t>The mechanisms defined in this document are agnostic to the tunneling
      technologies. These can be applied homogeneously to intra-domain
      tunneling technologies used in brownfield networks (e.g. MPLS Traffic
      Engineering (TE)) as well as greenfield networks (e.g. Segment Routing
      (SR)).</t>

      <t>The constructs defined in this document are used to classify and
      group these intra-domain tunnels based on their TE characteristics
      (e.g., low latency), into identifiable classes, thus making them
      "intent-aware". These constructs enable services to express their
      desired intent using one or more identifiable classes, and to
      selectively map traffic onto "intent-aware" intra-domain tunnels only
      within the scope of these classes.</t>

      <t>This document introduces a new BGP address family, called "BGP
      Classful Transport", that extends/stitches intent-aware intra-domain
      tunnels that belong to the same class across domain boundaries, to
      establish end-to-end intent-aware paths between service endpoints.</t>

      <t><xref target="Intent-Routing-Color"/> describes various use cases and
      applications of the procedures described in this document.</t>

      <t>To achieve end-to-end "Intent Driven Service Mapping", this document
      defines the following constructs and BGP extensions:<list>
          <t>The <xref target="tc">"Transport Class"</xref> construct to group
          underlay tunnels with sufficiently similar TE characteristics.</t>

          <t>The <xref target="Nexthop_Resoln_Schm">"Resolution Scheme"</xref>
          construct for overlay routes with Mapping Community to resolve next
          hop reachability from either one or an ordered set of Transport
          Classes.</t>

          <t>The <xref target="ct-family">"BGP Classful Transport"</xref>
          family to extend these constructs to adjacent domains.</t>
        </list><xref target="ArchOv"/>, depicts the intra-AS and inter-AS
      application of these constructs.</t>

      <t>The tunneling mechanisms are made "Transport Class" aware. They
      publish their underlay tunnels for a Transport Class into an associated
      <xref target="trdb">"Transport Route Database" (TRDB)</xref>. In <xref
      target="ArchOv"/>, RSVP-TE publishes its underlay tunnels into TRDBs
      created for Transport Class 100 and 200 at BN11 and PE12 within AS1;
      Similarly, SR-TE publishes its underlay tunnels into TRDBs created for
      Transport Class 100 and 200 at PE21 within AS2.</t>

      <t>The underlay route in a TRDB can be advertised in BGP to extend an
      underlay tunnel to adjacent domains. A new BGP transport layer address
      family called "BGP Classful Transport", aka BGP CT (AFI/SAFIs 1/76,
      2/76) is defined for this purpose. BGP CT makes it possible to advertise
      multiple tunnels to the same destination address, thus avoiding the need
      for multiple loopbacks on the Egress Service Node (eSN).</t>

      <t>BGP CT family carries transport prefixes across tunnel domain
      boundaries (e.g., in inter-AS Option C networks), which is parallel to
      BGP LU (AFI/SAFIs 1/4 or 2/4). It disseminates "Transport Class"
      information for the transport prefixes across the participating domains,
      which is not possible with BGP LU. This makes the end-to-end network a
      "Transport Class" aware tunneled network.</t>

      <t>In <xref target="ArchOv"/>, BGP CT routes are originated at BN11 in
      AS1 with next hop "self" towards BN21 in AS2 to extend available RSVP-TE
      tunnels for Transport Class 100 and 200 in AS1. BN21 propagates these
      routes with next hop "self" onto PE21.</t>

      <t>Overlay routes carry sufficient indication of the desired Transport
      Classes using a BGP community which assumes the role of as a "Mapping
      Community". A Resolution Scheme is identified by its "Mapping
      Community", where its configuration can either be auto-generated or done
      manually.</t>

      <t>The following text illustrates BGP CT having the property of
      providing tiered fallback options at a per-route granularity. In <xref
      target="ArchOv"/>, the Resolution Schemes are shown and the following
      next hop resolutions are done by PE12 and PE21:<list>
          <t>Resolve IP1 next hop over available tunnels in TRDB for Transport
          Class 100 with fallback to TRDB for best-effort.</t>

          <t>Resolve IP2 next hop over available tunnels in TRDB for Transport
          Class 200 with fallback to TRDB for best-effort.</t>

          <t>Resolve IP3 next hop over available tunnels in TRDB for Transport
          Class 100 with fallback to TRDB for Transport Class 200.</t>
        </list>In <xref target="ArchOv"/>, PE12 resolves IP1, IP2 and IP3
      directly over RSVP-TE tunnels in AS1. PE21 resolves IP1, IP2 and IP3
      over extended BGP-CT tunnels that resolve over SR-TE tunnels in AS2.</t>

      <t>This document describes procedures using MPLS forwarding
      architecture. However, these procedures would work in a similar manner for
      non-MPLS forwarding architectures as well. <xref target="SRv6-Support"/>
      describes the application of BGP CT over SRv6 data plane.</t>
    </section>

    <section anchor="tc" title="Transport Class">
      <t>Transport Class is a construct that groups transport tunnels offering
      similar SLA within the administrative domain of a provider network or
      closely coordinated provider networks. A Transport Class is configured
      at SNs and BNs with RD and RT attributes. Creation of a Transport Class
      instantiates its corresponding TRDB on that node.</t>

      <t>A Transport Class is identified by a unique 32-bit "Transport Class"
      identifier, that is assigned by the operator. An operator may configure
      an SN/BN to classify a tunnel into an appropriate Transport Class. How
      exactly these tunnels are made Transport Class aware is implementation
      specific and outside the scope of this document.</t>

      <t>When a tunnel is made Transport Class aware, it causes the Tunnel
      Ingress Route to be installed in the corresponding TRDB of that
      Transport Class. These routes are used to resolve BGP routes including
      BGP CT, which may be further readvertised to adjacent domains to extend
      these tunnels. While readvertising BGP CT routes, the "Transport Class"
      identifier is encoded as part of the Transport Class RT, which is a new
      Route Target extended community.</t>

      <t>An SN/BN receiving the transport routes via BGP with sufficient
      signaling information to identify a Transport Class can associate those
      ingress routes to the corresponding Transport Class. E.g., for Classful
      Transport family (AFI/SAFIs, 1/76 or 2/76) routes, the Transport Class
      RT indicates the Transport Class. For BGP LU family (AFI/SAFIs, 1/4 or
      2/4) routes, import processing based on Communities or Inter-AS
      source-peer may be used to place the route in the desired Transport
      Class.</t>

      <t>When the ingress route is received via <xref target="SRTE"/> with
      "Color:Endpoint" as the NLRI that encodes the Transport Class as an
      integer 'Color', the 'Color' is mapped to a Transport Class during the
      import processing. The SRTE ingress route for this 'Endpoint' is
      installed in the corresponding TRDB. The SRTE tunnel will be extended by
      a BGP CT advertisement with NLRI 'RD:Endpoint', Transport Class RT and a
      new label. The MPLS swap route thus installed for the new label will pop
      the label and forward the decapsulated traffic into the path determined
      by the SRTE route for further encapsulation.</t>

      <t><xref target="PCEP-SRTE-COLOR"/> extends Path Computation Element
      Communication Protocol (PCEP) to carry SRTE Color. This color
      association learnt from PCEP is also mapped to a Transport Class thus
      associating the PCEP driven SRTE LSP with the desired Transport
      Class.</t>

      <t>Similarly, <xref target="PCEP-RSVP-COLOR"/> extends PCEP to carry
      RSVP Color. This color association learnt from PCEP is also mapped to a
      Transport Class thus associating the PCEP driven RSVP-TE LSP with the
      desired Transport Class.</t>

      <section anchor="tc-te" title="Classifying TE tunnels">
        <t>TE tunnels can be classified within a Transport Class based on the
        TE attributes they possess and the TE characteristics that the
        operator defines for that Transport Class. Due to the fact that
        multiple TE tunneling protocols exist, their TE attributes and
        characteristics may not be equal but sufficiently similar. Some
        examples of such classifications are as follows:<list>
            <t>Tunnels (RSVP-TE, IGP FLEX-ALGO, SR-TE) with a latency no
            greater than 100ms.</t>

            <t>RSVP-TE Tunnels that only go over admin-group with Green
            links.</t>

            <t>Tunnels (RSVP-TE, SR-TE) that offer Fast Reroute.</t>

            <t>Tunnels (RSVP-TE, SR-TE) that share resources in the network
            based on Shared Risk Link Groups defined by TE policy.</t>

            <t>Tunnels (RSVP-TE, SR-TE, BGP-CT) that avoid certain nodes in
            the network based on RSVP-TE ERO, SR-TE policy or BGP policy.</t>
          </list></t>
      </section>

      <section anchor="trdb" title="Transport Route Database">
        <t>A Transport Route Database is a logical collection of transport
        routes pertaining to the same Transport Class. In any node, every

        next hop reachability using the transport routes within the scope of

    <section anchor="Nexthop_Resoln_Schm" title="Resolution Scheme">
      <t>This section defines the Resolution Scheme construct that is used to
      specify how a service route or a BGP CT route can resolve its next hop
      using its associated Mapping Community over a specific TRDB or an
      ordered set of TRDBs.</t>

      <t>Resolution Schemes enable a BGP speaker to resolve next hop
      reachability for overlay routes over the appropriate underlay tunnels
      within the scope of the TRDBs identified by the Mapping Community.
      Longest Prefix Match (LPM) of the next hop is performed within the
      identified TRDB.</t>

      <t>An implementation may provide an option for the overlay route to
      resolve over less preferred Transport Classes, should the resolution
      over a primary Transport Class fail.</t>

      <t>To accomplish this, the set of overlay routes may be associated with
      a user configured "Resolution Scheme" that consists of the "Mapping
      Community" and the primary Transport Class, which is used to realize the
      desired intent. The Resolution Scheme may also be configured to include
      an ordered list of fallback Transport Classes.</t>

      <t>Mapping community is a "role" and not a new type of community; any
      BGP Community or Extended Community may play this role. A Mapping
      Community maps to exactly one Resolution Scheme.</t>

      <t>An example of mapping community is "color:0:100", described in <xref
      target="RFC9012"/>, or the "transport-target:0:100" described in <xref
      target="tc-rt"/> in this document.</t>

      <t>A BGP route is associated with a resolution scheme during import
      processing. The first community on the route that matches a Mapping
      Community of a locally configured Resolution Scheme is considered the
      effective Mapping Community for the route. The Resolution Scheme thus
      found is used when resolving the route's PNH. If a route contains more
      than one Mapping Community, it indicates that the route considers these
      distinct Mapping Communities as equivalent in Intent. So, the first
      community that maps to a Resolution Scheme is chosen as the effective
      Mapping Community.</t>

      <t>A transport route received in BGP Classful Transport family SHOULD
      use a Resolution Scheme that contains only the primary Transport Class
      without any fallback to best effort tunnels. A service route received in
      a BGP service family (e.g., AFI/SAFI: 1/1, 2/1) SHOULD use a Resolution
      Scheme that contains the primary Transport Class along with fallback to
      best effort tunnels. The administrator MAY customize the resolution
      schemes to map to a different ordered list of TRDBs.</t>

        <t>AFI/SAFI 1/128 (MPLS-labeled VPN address) is an RFC8277 encoded
        family that carries service prefixes in the NLRI, where the prefixes
        come from the customer namespaces and are contextualized into separate
        user virtual service RIBs called VRFs as per [RFC4364].</t>

        <t>AFI/SAFI 1/4 (BGP LU) is an RFC8277 encoded family that carries
        transport prefixes in the NLRI, where the prefixes come from the
        provider namespace.</t>

        <t>AFI/SAFI 1/76 (Classful Transport SAFI) is an RFC8277 encoded
        family that carries transport prefixes in the NLRI, where the prefixes
        come from the provider namespace and are contextualized into separate
        TRDB as per RFC4364 procedures.</t>

        <t>It is worth noting that AFI/SAFI 1/128 has been used to carry
        transport prefixes in "L3VPN Inter-AS Carrier's carrier" scenario as
        defined in Section 10 of <xref target="RFC4364"/>, where BGP LU/LDP
        prefixes in CsC VRF are advertised in AFI/SAFI 1/128 towards the
        remote-end client carrier.</t>

        <t>In this document, SAFI 76 (BGP CT) is used instead of reusing SAFI
        128 (BGP VPN) for AFIs 1 or 2 to carry these transport routes because
        it is operationally advantageous to segregate transport and service
        prefixes into separate address families. For e.g., such an approach
        allows operators to safely enable "per-prefix" label allocation scheme
        for Classful Transport prefixes, typically with a space complexity of
        O(1K), without affecting SAFI 128 service prefixes, with a space
        complexity of O(1M). The "per prefix" label allocation scheme keeps
        the routing churn local during topology changes.</t>

        <t>A new SAFI for AFI 1 and 2 also facilitates having a different
        readvertisement path of the transport family routes in a network than
        the service route readvertisement path. Service routes (Inet-VPN) are
        exchanged over an EBGP multihop session between ASes with next hop
        unchanged; whereas Classful Transport routes are readvertised over
        EBGP single hop sessions with "next hop self" rewrite over inter-AS
        links.</t>

        <t>The Classful Transport SAFI for AFI 1 and 2 is similar in vein to
        BGP LU, in that it carries transport prefixes. The only difference is
        that it also carries in Route Target, an indication of which Transport
        Class the transport prefix belongs to and uses RD to disambiguate
        multiple instances of the same transport prefix in a BGP Update.</t>

      <section anchor="rd-lbl-usage"
               title="Usage of Route Distinguisher and Label Allocation Modes">
        <t>RDs aid in troubleshooting provider networks that deploy BGP CT, by
        uniquely identifying the originator of a route across an
        administrative domain that may either span multiple domains within a
        provider network or span closely coordinated provider networks.</t>

        <t>The use of RDs also provides an option for signaling forwarding
        diversity within the same Transport Class. An SN can advertise an SEP
        with the same Transport Class in multiple BGP CT routes with unique
        RDs.</t>

        <t>For e.g., unique "RDx:EP1" prefixes can be advertised by an SN for
        an EP1 to different upstream BNs with unique forwarding specific
        encapsulation (e.g., Label), in order to collect traffic statistics at
        the SN for each BN. In absence of RD, duplicated Transport Class/Color
        values will be needed in the transport network to achieve such use
        cases.</t>

        <t>The allocation of RDs is done at the point of origin of the BGP CT
        route. This can either be an Egress SN or a BN. The default RD
        allocation mode is to use a unique RD per originating node for an EP.
        This mode allows for the ingress to uniquely identify each originated
        path. Alternatively, the same RD may be provisioned for multiple
        originators of the same EP. This mode can be used when the ingress
        does not require full visibility of all nodes originating an EP.</t>

        <t>A label is allocated for a BGP CT route when it is advertised with
        next hop self by a SN or a BN. An implementation may use different
        label allocation modes with BGP CT. The recommended label allocation
        mode is per-prefix as it provides better traffic convergence
        properties than per-next hop label allocation mode. Furthermore, BGP
        CT offers two flavors for per-prefix label allocation. The first
        flavor assigns a label for each unique "RD, EP". The second flavor
        assigns a label for each unique "Transport Class, EP" while ignoring
        the RD.</t>

        <t>In a BGP CT network, the number of routes at an Ingress PE is a
        function of unique EPs multiplied by BNs in the ingress domain that do
        next hop self. BGP CT provides flexible RD and Label allocation modes
        to address operational requirements in a multi-domain network. The
        impacts on the control plane and forwarding behavior for the above
        modes are detailed with an example in <xref

            <t>The egress node of the tunnel i.e. the tunnel endpoint

          <t>Upon receipt of a BGP Classful Transport route with a PNH that is
          not directly connected (e.g. an IBGP-route), a Mapping Community on
          the route (the Transport Class RT) is used to decide to which
          resolution scheme this route is to be mapped. The resolution scheme
          for a Transport Class RT with Transport Class ID "C1" contains TRDB
          for Transport Class with same ID. In cases where Transport Class
          "C1" tunnels are not available in a domain, the administrator MAY
          customize the resolution scheme to map to a different set of
          transport classes available in that domain.</t>

          <t>The routes in the associated TRDBs are used to resolve the
          received PNH. The order of TRDBs in a resolution scheme is followed

          used only when a matching route was not found in the primary TRDBs
          preceding it. This achieves the fallback desired by the resolution
          scheme.</t>

          <t>BNs allocate an MPLS label to advertise upstream in Classful
          Transport NLRI. A BN also installs an MPLS route for that label that
          swaps the incoming label with a label received from the downstream
          BGP speaker or pops the incoming label. It then pushes received
          traffic to the transport tunnel or direct interface that the
          Classful Transport route's PNH resolved over.</t>

          <t>The label SHOULD be allocated with "per-prefix" label allocation
          semantics. The IP prefix in the TRDB context (Transport-Class,
          IP-prefix) is used as the key to do per-prefix label allocation.
          This helps in avoiding BGP CT route churn throughout the CT network
          when an instability (e.g. link failure) is experienced in a domain.
          The failure is not propagated further than the BN closest to the
          failure. If a different label allocation mode is used, impact on end
          to end convergence should be considered.</t>

      <section title="Avoiding Path Hiding Through Route Reflectors">
        <list>
          <t>When multiple BNs exist such that they advertise a "RD:EP" prefix
          to Route Reflectors (RRs), the RRs may hide all but one of the BNs,
          unless <xref target="RFC7911">ADDPATH</xref> is used for the
          Classful Transport family. This is similar to L3VPN Option B
          scenarios. Hence, ADDPATH SHOULD be used for Classful Transport
          family, to avoid path-hiding through RRs. This improves convergence
          time when path via one of the multiple BNs fails.</t>

      <section title="Avoiding Loops Between Route Reflectors in Forwarding Path">
        <list>
          <t>A pair of redundant ABRs, each acting as an RR with next hop
          self, may choose each other as best path instead of the upstream
          ASBR, causing a traffic forwarding loop. This happens because of
          following the path selection rule specified in <xref
          target="RFC4456">Section 9 of BGP RR</xref> that tie-breaks on
          ORIGINATOR_ID before CLUSTER_LIST. RFC4456 considers pure RR which
          is not in forwarding path. When a RR is in forwarding path and
          reflects routes with next hop self, as is the case for ABR BNs in a
          BGP transport network, this rule may cause loops.</t>

          <t>Implementations SHOULD provide a way to alter the tie-breaking
          rule specified in <xref target="RFC4456">Section 9 of BGP RR</xref>
          so as to tie-break on CLUSTER_LIST step before ORIGINATOR_ID step,
          when performing path selection for BGP CT routes.</t>

          <t>This document suggests the following modification to the BGP
          Decision Process Tie Breaking rules (Section. 9.1.2.2 of <xref
          target="RFC4271"/>) that can be applied to path selection of BGP CT
          family routes:</t>

          <t>The following rule SHOULD be inserted between Steps e) and f): a
          BGP Speaker SHOULD prefer a route with the shorter CLUSTER_LIST
          length. The CLUSTER_LIST length is zero if a route does not carry
          the CLUSTER_LIST attribute.</t>

          <t>Taking into account some other deployment considerations can also
          help in avoiding this problem, e.g.,: <list>
              <t>IGP metric should be assigned such that "ABR to redundant
              ABR" cost is inferior than "ABR to upstream ASBR" cost.</t>

              <t>Tunnels belonging to non-best effort Transport Classes SHOULD
              NOT be provisioned between ABRs. This will ensure that the route
              received from an ABR with next hop self will not be usable at a
              redundant ABR.</t>
            </list> Using one or more of the above approaches softens the
          possibility of such loops in a network with redundant ABRs.</t>

      <section title="Ingress Nodes Receiving Service Routes with a Mapping Community">
        <list>
          <t>Upon receipt of a BGP service route with a PNH that is not
          directly connected (e.g. an IBGP-route), a Mapping Community on the
          route (e.g, Color Extended Community) is used to decide to which
          resolution scheme this route is to be mapped. The resolution scheme
          for a Color Extended Community with Color "C1" contains TRDB for
          Transport Class with same ID, followed by Best-Effort TRDB. The
          administrator MAY customize the resolution scheme to map to a
          different ordered list of TRDBs.</t>

          <t>The routes in the associated TRDBs are used to resolve the
          received PNH. The order of TRDBs in a resolution scheme is followed
          when resolving the received PNH, such that a route in backup TRDB is
          used only when a matching route was not found in the primary TRDBs
          preceding it. This achieves the fallback desired by the resolution
          scheme.</t>

          <t>If the resolution process does not find a Tunnel Ingress Route in
          any of the Transport Route Databases, the service route MUST be
          considered unusable for forwarding purpose and be withdrawn.</t>

          <t>Cooperating Inter-AS Option C domains may sometimes not agree on
          RT, RD, Mapping community or Transport Route Target values because
          of differences in community namespaces (e.g. during network mergers
          or renumbering for expansion). Such deployments may deploy
          mechanisms to map and rewrite the Route Target values on domain
          boundaries, using per ASBR import policies. This is no different
          than any other BGP VPN family. Mechanisms used in inter-AS VPN
          deployments may be leveraged with the Classful Transport family
          also.</t>

          <t>The resolution schemes SHOULD allow association with multiple

      <section title="Best Effort Transport Class">
        <list>
          <t>It is possible to represent 'Best effort' SLA also as a Transport
          Class. Today, BGP LU (e.g. AFI/SAFI 1/4) is used to extend the best
          effort intra domain tunnels to other domains.</t>

          <t>Alternatively, BGP CT (e.g. AFI/SAFI 1/76) may be used to carry
          the best effort tunnels also. This document reserves the Transport
          Class ID value 0 to represent "Best Effort Transport Class ID".
          However, implementations SHOULD provide configuration to use a
          different value for this purpose. Procedures to manage differences
          in Transport Class ID namespaces between domains are provided in
          <xref target="non-agreeing"/>.</t>

          <t>The 'Best Effort Transport Class ID' value is used in the
          'Transport Class ID' field of Transport Route Target Extended
          Community that is attached to the BGP CT route that advertises a
          best effort tunnel endpoint. The RT thus formed is called the "Best
          Effort Transport Class Route Target".</t>

          <t>When a BN or SN receives a BGP CT route with Best Effort
          Transport Class Route Target as the mapping community, the Best
          effort resolution scheme is used for resolving the BGP next hop, and
          the resultant route is installed in the best effort transport route
          database. If no best effort tunnel was found to resolve the BGP next
          hop, the BGP CT route MUST be considered unusable, and not be
          propagated further.</t>

          <t>When a BGP speaker receives an overlay route without any explicit
          Mapping Community, and absent local policy, the best effort
          resolution scheme is used for resolving the BGP next hop on the
          route. This behavior is backward compatible to behavior of an
          implementation that does not follow procedures described in this
          document.</t>

          <t>Implementations MAY provide configuration to selectively install
          BGP CT routes to the Forwarding Information Base (FIB), to provide
          reachability for control plane peering towards endpoints in other
          domains.</t>

        encapsulation. This attribute may apply to BGP service routes or

        <t>The mechanisms described in <xref target="MULTI-NH-ATTR">BGP
        MultiNexthop Attribute</xref> allow a BGP route to carry multiple next

        <t>It should be noted that in such cases "Transport Class/Color" can
        exist in multiple places on the same route, and a precedence order
        needs to be established to determine which Transport Class the route's
        next hop should resolve over. This document suggests the following
        order of precedence, more preferred first: <list>
            <t>Transport Class ID SubTLV, in MultiNexthop Attribute.</t>

            <t>Color SubTLV, in Tunnel Encapsulation Attribute.</t>

            <t>Color Extended community, on BGP service route.</t>
          </list> The above precedence order follows more specific scoping of
        Color to less specific scoping.</t>

        <t>Transport Class ID specified for Nexthop-Leg subTLV in a
        MultiNextHop attribute is more specific indication of Color than Color
        subTLV in a TEA, which in turn is more specific than Mapping Community
        (Transport Target) on a BGP CT transport route, which is in turn more
        specific than a Service route scoped Mapping Community (Color Extended

          <t>It is recommended to follow this for BGP CT routes. It will

          This will conserve usage of MPLS label and next hop resources in the
          network. An ASBR of a domain can be provisioned to allow routes with

      <section title="Constrained Distribution of PNHs to SNs (On-Demand Next Hop)">
        <list>
          <t>This section describes how the number of Protocol Next hops
          advertised to a SN or BN can be constrained using BGP Classful
          Transport and <xref target="RFC4684">Route Target Constraints
          (RTC)</xref>.</t>

          <t>An egress SN MAY advertise BGP CT route for RD:eSN with two Route
          Targets: transport-target:0:&lt;TC&gt; and a RT carrying
          &lt;eSN&gt;:&lt;TC&gt;. Where TC is the Transport Class identifier,
          and eSN is the IP-address used by SN as BGP next hop in its service
          route advertisements.</t>

          <t>Note that such use of the IP address specific route target
          &lt;eSN&gt;:&lt;TC&gt; is optional in a BGP CT network. It is
          required only if there is a requirement to prune the propagation of
          the transport route for an egress node eSN to only the set of
          ingress nodes that need it. When only RT of
          transport-target:0:&lt;TC&gt; is used, the pruning happens in
          granularity of Transport Class ID (Color), and not BGP next hop; BGP
          CT routes will not be advertised into domains with PEs that don't
          import its transport class.</t>

          <t>The transport-target:0:&lt;TC&gt; is the new type of route target
          (Transport Class RT) defined in this document. It is carried in BGP
          extended community attribute (BGP attribute code 16).</t>

          <t>The RT carrying &lt;eSN&gt;:&lt;TC&gt; MAY be an IP-address
          specific regular RT (BGP attribute code 16), IPv6-address specific
          RT (BGP attribute code 25), or a Wide-communities based RT (BGP
          attribute code 34) as described in <xref target="RTC-Ext">Route
          Target Constrain Extension</xref>. This document recommends using
          Wide-communities based RT for the same.</t>

          <t>An ingress SN MAY import BGP CT routes with Route Target carrying
          &lt;eSN&gt;:&lt;TC&gt;. The ingress SN may learn the eSN values
          either by configuration, or it may discover them from the BGP next
          hop field in the BGP VPN service routes received from eSN. A BGP
          ingress SN receiving a BGP service route with next hop of eSN
          generates a RTC/Extended-RTC route for Route Target prefix
          &lt;Origin ASN&gt;:&lt;eSN&gt;/[80|176] in order to learn BGP CT
          transport routes to reach eSN. This allows constrained distribution
          of the transport routes to the PNHs actually required by iSN.</t>

          <t>When the path of route propagation of BGP CT routes is same as
          the RTC routes, a BN would learn the RTC routes advertised by
          ingress SNs and propagate further. This will allow constraining
          distribution of BGP CT routes for a PNH to only the necessary BNs in
          the network, closer to the egress SN.</t>

          <t>This mechanism provides "On Demand Next hop" of BGP CT routes,
          which help with the scaling of MPLS forwarding state at SN and
          BN.</t>

          <t>However, the amount of state carried in RTC family may become
          proportional to the number of PNHs in the network. To strike a
          balance, the RTC route advertisements for &lt;Origin
          ASN&gt;:&lt;eSN&gt;/[80|176] MAY be confined to the BNs in home
          region of ingress-SN, or the BNs of a super core.</t>

          <t>Such a BN in the core of the network imports BGP CT routes with
          Transport-Target:0:&lt;TC&gt; and generates a RTC route for
          &lt;Origin ASN&gt;:0:&lt;TC&gt;/96, while not propagating the more
          specific RTC requests for specific PNHs. This lets the BN learn
          transport routes to all eSN nodes but confine their propagation to
          ingress-SNs.</t>

      <section title="Limiting The Visibility Scope of PE Loopback as PNHs">
        <list>
          <t>It may be even more desirable to limit the number of PNHs that

          <t>Such that advertisement of PE loopback addresses as next-hop in
          BGP service routes is confined to the region they belong to. An
          anycast IP-address called "Context Protocol Nexthop Address" (CPNH,

          regions in the network, swapping the SN scoped service label with a
          CPNH scoped private namespace label.</t>

          <t>This provides much greater advantage in terms of scaling and

        <t>This example shows a provider network that consists of two ASes,
        AS1 and AS2. They are serving customers AS3, AS4 respectively. Traffic
        direction being described is CE41 to CE31. CE31 may request a specific
        SLA (e.g. mapped to Gold for this example), when traversing these
        provider networks.</t>

        <t>AS2 is further divided into two regions. So, there are three tunnel
        domains in provider's space. AS1 uses <xref target="RFC9350">ISIS
        Flex-Algo</xref> intra-domain tunnels, whereas AS2 uses RSVP-TE
        intra-domain tunnels.</t>

        <t>The network exposes two Transport Classes: "Gold" with Transport
        Class id 100, "Bronze" with Transport Class id 200. These Transport
        Classes are provisioned at the PEs and the Border nodes (ABRs, ASBRs)
        in the network.</t>

        <t>Following tunnels exist for Gold Transport Class.<list>
            <t>PE25_to_ABR23_gold - RSVP-TE tunnel</t>

            <t>PE25_to_ABR24_gold - RSVP-TE tunnel</t>

      <section title="Service Layer Route Exchange">
        <t>Service nodes PE11, PE12 negotiate service families (AFI: 1 and
        SAFIs 1, 128) on the BGP session with RR16. Service helpers RR16 and
        RR26 exchange these service routes with next hop unchanged over a
        multihop EBGP session between the two AS. PE25 negotiates service
        families (AFI: 1 and SAFIs 1, 128) with RR26.</t>

        <t>The PEs see each other as next hop in the BGP Update for the
        service family routes. Addpath send, receive is enabled on both
        directions on the EBGP multihop session between RR16 and RR26 for
        AFI:1 and SAFIs 1, 128. Addpath send is negotiated in the RR to PE
        direction in each AS. This is to avoid path hiding of service routes
        at RR. E.g. AFI/SAFI 1/1 routes advertised by both PE11 and PE12. Or,
        AFI/SAFI 1/128 routes originated by both PE11 and PE12 using same
        RD.</t>

        <t>Forwarding happens using service routes installed at service nodes
        PE25, PE11, PE12 only. Service routes received from CEs are not
        present in any other nodes' FIB in the network.</t>

        <t>As an example, CE31 advertises a route for prefix 203.0.113.31 with
        next hop as self to PE11, PE12. CE31 can attach a Mapping Community
        Color:0:100 on this route, to indicate its request for Gold SLA. Or,
        PE11 can attach the same using locally configured policies.</t>

        <t>Consider, CE31 is getting VPN service from PE11. The
        RD1:203.0.113.31 route is readvertised in AFI/SAFI 1/128 by PE11 with
        next hop self (192.0.2.11) and label V-L1, to RR16 with the Mapping
        Community Color:0:100 attached. RR16 advertises this route with
        Addpath-ID to RR26 which readvertises to PE25 with next hop unchanged.
        Now, PE25 can resolve the PNH 192.0.2.11 using transport routes
        received in BGP CT or BGP LU.</t>

        <t>Using Addpath, service routes advertised by PE11 and PE12 for AFI:1
        SAFIs 1, 128 reach PE25 via RR16, RR26 with the next hop unchanged, as
        PE11 or PE12.</t>

        <t>The IP FIB at PE25 VRF will have a route for 203.0.113.31 with a
        next hop when resolved, that points to a Gold tunnel in ingress
        domain.</t>
      </section>

      <section title="Transport Layer Route Propagation">
        <t>Egress nodes PE11, PE12 negotiate BGP CT family with transport
        ASBRs ASBR13, ASBR14. These egress nodes originate BGP CT routes for
        tunnel endpoint addresses, that are advertised as next hop in BGP
        service routes. In this example, both PEs participate in transport
        classes Gold and Bronze. The protocol procedures are explained using the
        Gold SLA transport plane and the Bronze SLA transport plane is used to
        highlight the path hiding aspects.</t>

        <t>PE11 is provisioned with transport class 100, RD value
        192.0.2.11:100 and a transport-target:0:100 for Gold tunnels. And a
        Transport class 200 with RD value 192.0.2.11:200, and transport route
        target 0:200 for Bronze tunnels. Similarly, PE12 is provisioned with
        transport class 100, RD value 192.0.2.12:100 and a
        transport-target:0:100 for Gold tunnels. And transport class 200, RD
        value 192.0.2.12:200 with transport-target:0:200 for Bronze tunnels.
        Note that in this example, the BGP CT routes carry only the transport
        class route target, and no IP address format route target.</t>

        <t>The RD value originated by an egress node is not modified by any
        BGP speakers when the route is readvertised to the ingress node. Thus,
        the RD can be used to identify the originator (unique RD provisioned)
        or set of originators (RD reused on multiple nodes).</t>

        <t>Similarly, these transport classes are also configured on ASBRs,
        ABRs and PEs with same Transport Route Target and unique RDs.</t>

        <t>ASBR13 and ASBR14 negotiate BGP CT family with transport ASBRs
        ASBR21, ASBR22 in neighboring AS. They negotiate BGP CT family with
        RR27 in region 2, which reflects BGP CT routes to ABR23, ABR24. ABR23,
        ABR24 negotiate BGP CT family with Ingress node PE25 in region 1. BGP
        LU family is also negotiated on these sessions alongside BGP CT
        family. BGP LU carries "best effort" transport class routes, BGP CT
        carries Gold, Bronze transport class routes.</t>

        <t>PE11 is provisioned to originate BGP CT route with Gold SLA to
        endpoint PE11. This route is sent with NLRI RD prefix
        192.0.2.11:100:192.0.2.11, Label B-L0, next hop 192.0.2.11 and a route
        target extended community transport-target:0:100. Label B-L0 can
        either be Implicit Null (Label 3) or an Ultimate Hop Pop (UHP)
        label.</t>

        <t>This route is received by ASBR13 and it resolves over the tunnel
        ASBR13_to_PE11_gold. The route is then readvertised by ASBR13 in BGP
        CT family to ASBRs ASBR21, ASBR22 according to export policy. This
        route is sent with same NLRI RD prefix 192.0.2.11:100:192.0.2.11,
        Label B-L1, next hop self, and transport-target:0:100. MPLS swap route
        is installed at ASBR13 for B-L1 with a next hop pointing to
        ASBR13_to_PE11_gold tunnel.</t>

        <t>Similarly, ASBR14 also receives a BGP CT route for
        192.0.2.11:100:192.0.2.11 from PE11 and it resolves over the tunnel
        ASBR14_to_PE11_gold. The route is then readvertised by ASBR14 in BGP
        CT family to ASBRs ASBR21, ASBR22 according to export policy. This
        route is sent with the same NLRI RD prefix 192.0.2.11:100:192.0.2.11,
        Label B-L2, next hop self, and transport-target:0:100. MPLS swap route
        is installed at ASBR14 for B-L1 with a next hop pointing to
        ASBR14_to_PE11_gold tunnel.</t>

        <t>In the Bronze plane, BGP CT route with Bronze SLA to endpoint PE11
        is originated by PE11 with a NLRI containing RD prefix
        192.0.2.11:200:192.0.2.11, and appropriate label. The RD allows both
        Gold and Bronze advertisements to traverse path selection pinchpoints
        without any path hiding at RRs or ASBRs. And route target extended
        community transport-target:0:200 lets the route resolve over Bronze
        tunnels in the network, similar to the process being described for
        Gold SLA path.</t>

        <t>Moving back to the Gold plane, ASBR21 receives the Gold SLA BGP CT
        routes for NLRI RD prefix 192.0.2.11:100:192.0.2.11 over the single
        hop EBGP sessions from ASBR13, ASBR14, and can compute ECMP/FRR
        towards them. ASBR21 readvertises BGP CT route for
        192.0.2.11:100:192.0.2.11 with next hop self (loopback address
        192.0.2.21) to RR27, advertising a new label B-L3. An MPLS swap route is
        installed for label B-L3 at ASBR21 to swap to received label B-L1,
        B-L2 and forward to ASBR13, ASBR14 respectively. RR27 readvertises
        this BGP CT route to ABR23, ABR24 with label and next hop
        unchanged.</t>

        <t>Similarly, ASBR22 receives BGP CT route 192.0.2.11:100:192.0.2.11
        over the single hop EBGP sessions from ASBR13, ASBR14, and
        readvertises with next hop self (loopback address 192.0.2.22) to RR27,
        advertising a new label B-L4. An MPLS swap route is installed for label
        B-L4 at ASBR22 to swap to received label B-L1, B-L2 and forward to
        ASBR13, ASBR14 respectively. RR27 readvertises this BGP CT route also
        to ABR23, ABR24 with label and next hop unchanged.</t>

        <t>Addpath is enabled for BGP CT family on the sessions between RR27
        and ASBRs, ABRs such that routes for 192.0.2.11:100:192.0.2.11 with
        the next hops ASBR21 and ASBR22 are reflected to ABR23, ABR24 without
        any path hiding. Thus, ABR23 is given visibility of both available next
        hops for Gold SLA.</t>

        <t>ABR23 receives the route with next hop 192.0.2.21, label B-L3 from
        RR27. The route target "transport-target:0:100" on this route acts as
        Mapping Community, and instructs ABR23 to strictly resolve the next
        hop using transport class 100 routes only. ABR23 is unable to find a
        route for 192.0.2.21 with transport class 100. Thus, it considers this
        route unusable and does not propagate it further. This prunes ASBR21
        from Gold SLA tunneled path.</t>

        <t>ABR23 also receives the route with next hop 192.0.2.22, label B-L4
        from RR27. The route target "transport-target:0:100" on this route
        acts as Mapping Community, and instructs ABR23 to strictly resolve the
        next hop using transport class 100 routes only. ABR23 successfully
        resolves the next hop to point to ABR23_to_ASBR22_gold tunnel. ABR23
        readvertises this BGP CT route with next hop self (loopback address
        192.0.2.23) and a new label B-L5 to PE25. Swap route for B-L5 is
        installed by ABR23 to swap to label B-L4, and forward into
        ABR23_to_ASBR22_gold tunnel.</t>

        <t>PE25 receives the BGP CT route for prefix 192.0.2.11:100:192.0.2.11
        with label B-L5, next hop 192.0.2.23 and transport-target:0:100 from
        RR26. And it similarly resolves the next hop 192.0.2.23 over transport
        class 100, pushing labels associated with PE25_to_ABR23_gold
        tunnel.</t>

        <t>In this manner, the Gold transport LSP "ASBR13_to_PE11_gold" in
        egress-domain is extended by BGP CT until the ingress-node PE25 in
        ingress domain, to create an end-to-end Gold SLA path. MPLS swap
        routes are installed at ASBR13, ASBR22 and ABR23, when propagating the
        PE11 BGP CT Gold transport class route 192.0.2.11:100:192.0.2.11 with
        next hop self towards PE25.</t>

        <t>The BGP CT LSP thus formed, originates in PE25, and terminates in
        ASBR13 (assuming PE11 advertised Implicit Null), traversing over the
        Gold underlay LSPs in each domain. ASBR13 uses UHP to stitch the BGP
        CT LSP into the "ASBR13_to_PE11_gold" LSP to traverse the last domain,
        thus satisfying Gold SLA end-to-end.</t>

        <t>When PE25 receives service routes from RR26 with next hop
        192.0.2.11 and mapping community Color:0:100, it resolves over this
        BGP CT route 192.0.2.11:100:192.0.2.11. Thus, pushing label B-L5, and
        pushing as top label the labels associated with PE25_to_ABR23_gold
        tunnel.</t>
      </section>

      <section title="Data Plane View">
        <section title="Steady State">
          <t>This section describes how the data plane looks in steady
          state.</t>

          <t>CE41 transmits an IP packet with destination as 203.0.113.31. On
          receiving this packet, PE25 performs a lookup in the IP FIB
          associated with the CE41 interface. This lookup yields the service
          route that pushes the VPN service label V-L1, BGP CT label B-L5, and
          labels for PE25_to_ABR23_gold tunnel. Thus, PE25 encapsulates the IP
          packet in an MPLS packet with label V-L1(innermost), B-L5, and top
          label as PE25_to_ABR23_gold tunnel. This MPLS packet is thus
          transmitted to ABR23 using Gold SLA.</t>

          <t>ABR23 decapsulates the packet received on PE25_to_ABR23_gold
          tunnel as required, and finds the MPLS packet with label B-L5. It
          performs a lookup for label B-L5 in the global MPLS FIB. This yields
          the route that swaps label B-L5 with label B-L4, and pushes the top
          label provided by ABR23_to_ASBR22_gold tunnel. Thus, ABR23 transmits
          the MPLS packet with label B-L4 to ASBR22, on a tunnel that
          satisfies Gold SLA.</t>

          <t>ASBR22 similarly performs a lookup for label B-L4 in global MPLS
          FIB, finds the route that swaps label B-L4 with label B-L2, and
          forwards to ASBR13 over the directly connected MPLS-enabled
          interface. This interface is a common resource not dedicated to any
          specific transport class, in this example.</t>

          <t>ASBR13 receives the MPLS packet with label B-L2, and performs a
          lookup in MPLS FIB, finds the route that pops label B-L2, and pushes
          labels associated with ASBR13_to_PE11_gold tunnel. This transmits
          the MPLS packet with VPN label V-L1 to PE11 using a tunnel that
          preserves Gold SLA in AS 1.</t>

          <t>PE11 receives the MPLS packet with V-L1, and performs VPN
          forwarding. Thus transmitting the original IP payload from CE41 to
          CE31. The payload has traversed path satisfying Gold SLA
          end-to-end.</t>

        <section title="Local Repair of Primary Path">
          <t>This section describes how the data plane at ASBR22 reacts when
          the link between ASBR22 and ASBR13 experiences a failure, and an
          alternate path exists.</t>

          <t>Assuming ASBR22_to_ASBR13 link goes down, such that traffic with
          Gold SLA going to PE11 needs repair. ASBR22 has an alternate BGP CT
          route for 192.0.2.11:100:192.0.2.11 from ASBR14. This has been
          preprogrammed in forwarding by ASBR22 as FRR backup next hop for
          label B-L4. This allows the Gold SLA traffic to be locally repaired
          at ASBR22 without the failure event propagated in the BGP CT
          network. In this case, ingress node PE25 will not know there was a
          failure, and traffic restoration will be independent of prefix scale

        <section title="Absorbing Failure of Primary Path: Fallback to Best Effort Tunnels ">
          <t>This section describes how the data plane reacts when a Gold path
          experiences a failure, but no alternate path exists.</t>

          <t>Assume tunnel ABR23_to_ASBR22_gold goes down, such that now no
          end-to-end Gold path exists in the network. This makes the
          BGP CT route for RD prefix 192.0.2.11:100:192.0.2.11 is unusable at
          ABR23. This makes ABR23 send a BGP withdrawal for
          192.0.2.11:100:192.0.2.11 to PE25.</t>

          <t>The withdrawal for 192.0.2.11:100:192.0.2.11 allows PE25 to react to
          the loss of the Gold path to 192.0.2.11. Assuming PE25 is provisioned to
          use best-effort transport class as the backup path, this withdrawal
          of BGP CT route allows PE25 to adjust the next hop of the VPN
          Service-route to push the labels provided by the BGP LU route. That
          repairs the traffic to go via the best effort path. PE25 can also be
          provisioned to use Bronze transport class as the backup path. The
          repair will happen in similar manner in that case as-well.</t>

          <t>Traffic repair to absorb the failure happens at ingress node
          PE25, in a service prefix scale independent manner. This is called
          PIC (Prefix scale Independent Convergence). The repair time will be
          proportional to time taken for withdrawing the BGP CT route.</t>

          <t>The above examples demonstrate the various levels of failsafe
          mechanisms available to protect traffic in a BGP CT network.</t>

    <section title="Deployment Considerations.">
      <section title="Managing Intent at Service and Transport layers.">
        <t><xref target="CTProc">Illustration of BGP CT Procedures </xref>
        shows multiple domains that agree on a color name space (Agreeing
        Color Domains) and contain tunnels with equivalent sets of colors
        (Homogenous Color Domains).</t>

        <t>However, in the real world, this may not always be guaranteed. Two
        domains may independently manage their color namespaces; these are
        known as Non-Agreeing Color Domains. Two domains may have tunnels with
        unequal sets of colors; these are known as Heterogeneous Color
        Domains.</t>

        <t>This section describes how BGP CT is deployed in such scenarios to
        preserve end-to-end Intent. Examples described in this section use
        Inter-AS Option C domains. But similar mechanisms will work for
        Inter-AS Option A and Inter-AS Option B scenarios as well.</t>

        <section title="Service Layer Color Management ">
          <t>At the service layer, it is recommended that a global color
          namespace be maintained across multiple co-operating domains. BGP CT
          allows indirection using resolution schemes to be able to maintain a
          global namespace in the service layer. This is possible even if each
          domain independently maintains its own local transport color
          namespace.</t>

          <t>As explained in <xref target="Nexthop_Resoln_Schm">Next Hop
          Resolution Scheme</xref> , a mapping community carried on a service
          route maps to a resolution scheme. The mapping community values for
          the service route can be abstract and are not required to match the
          transport color namespace. This abstract mapping community value
          representing a global service layer intent is mapped to a local
          transport layer intent available in each domain.</t>

          <t>In this manner, it is recommended to keep color namespace
          management at the service layer and the transport layer decoupled
          from each other. In the following sections the service layer agrees
          on a single global namespace.</t>
        </section>

        <section anchor="non-agreeing"
                 title="Non-Agreeing Color Transport Domains">
          <t>Non-agreeing color domains require a mapping community rewrite on
          each domain boundary. This rewrite helps to map one domain's
          namespace to another.</t>

          <t>The following example illustrates how traffic is stitched and SLA is
          preserved when domains don't use the same namespace at the transport
          layer. Each domain specifies the same SLA using different color
          values.</t>

          </figure>

          <t>In the above topology shown in <xref
          target="BGPCT_NON_AGREEING_COLOR_DOMAIN"/>, we have three Autonomous
          Systems. All the nodes in the topology support BGP CT.</t>

          <t>In AS1 Gold SLA is represented by color 100 and Bronze by
          200.</t>

          <t>In AS2 Gold SLA is represented by color 300 and Bronze by
          400.</t>

          <t>In AS3 Gold SLA is represented by color 500 and Bronze by
          600.</t>

          <t>Though the color values are different, they map to tunnels with
          sufficiently similar TE characteristics in each domain.</t>

          <t>The service route carries an abstract mapping community that maps
          to the required SLA. For example, Service routes that need to
          resolve over Gold transport tunnels, carry a mapping community
          color:0:100500. In AS3 it maps to a resolution scheme containing
          TRDB with color 500 whereas in AS2 it maps to a TRDB with color 300
          and in AS1 it maps to a TRDB with color 100. Co-ordination is needed
          to provision the resolution schemes in each domain as explained
          above.</t>

          <t>At the AS boundary, the transport-class route-target is rewritten
          for the BGP CT routes. In the above topology, At ASBR31 the
          transport-target:0:500 for Gold tunnels is rewritten to
          transport-target:0:300 and then advertised to ASBR22. Similarly, the
          transport-target:0:300 for Gold tunnels are re-written to
          transport-target:0:100 at ASBR21 before advertising to ASBR11. At
          PE11, the transport route received with transport-target:0:100 will
          be added to the color 100 TRDB. The service route received with
          mapping community color:0:100500 at PE1 maps to the Gold TRDB and
          resolves over this transport route.</t>

          <t>Inter-domain traffic forwarding in the above topology works as
          explained in <xref target="CTProc"/>.</t>

          <t>Transport-target re-write requires co-ordination of color values
          between domains in the transport layer. This method avoids the need
          to re-write service route mapping communities, keeping the service
          layer homogenous and simple to manage. Coordinating Transport Class
          RT between adjacent domains is easier than coordinating service
          layer colors deployed in various non-adjacent domains.</t>
        </section>

        <section title="Heterogeneous Agreeing Color Transport Domains">
          <t>In a heterogeneous domains scenario, it might not be possible to
          map a service layer intent to the matching transport color, as the
          color might not be locally available in a domain.</t>

          <t>The following example illustrates how traffic is stitched, when a
          transit AS contains more shades for an SLA path compared to Ingress
          and Egress domains. This example shows how service routes can
          traverse through finer shades when available and take coarse shades
          otherwise.</t>

          <t>In the preceding topology shown in <xref
          target="BGPCT_HETERO_COLOR_DOMAIN"/>, we have three Autonomous
          Systems. All the nodes in the topology support BGP CT.</t>

          <t>In AS1 Gold SLA is represented by color 100.</t>

          <t>In AS2 Gold has finer shades: Gold1 by color 101 and Gold2 by
          color 102.</t>

          <t>In AS3 Gold SLA is represented by color 100.</t>

          <t>This problem can be solved by the two following approaches:</t>

          <section title="Duplicate Tunnels Approach">
            <t>In this approach, duplicate tunnels that satisfy Gold SLA are
            configured in domains AS1 and AS3, but they are given fine grained
            colors 101, 102.</t>

            <t>These tunnels will be installed in TRDBs corresponding to
            transport classes of color 101, 102.</t>

            <t>Service routes received with mapping community (eg:
            transport-target or color community) can resolve over these
            tunnels in the TRDB with matching color by using resolution
            schemes.</t>

            <t>This approach consumes more resources in the transport and
            forwarding layer, because of the duplicate tunnels.</t>
          </section>

          <section title="Customized Resolution Schemes Approach">
            <t>In this approach, resolution schemes in domains AS1 and AS3 are
            customized to map the received mapping community (e.g.,
            transport-target or color community) over available Gold SLA
            tunnels. This conserves resource usage with no additional state in
            transport and forwarding plane.</t>

            <t>Service routes advertised by PE31 that need to resolve over
            Gold1 transport tunnels carry a mapping community color:0:101. In
            AS3 and AS1, where Gold1 is not available, it is mapped to color
            100 TRDB using a customized resolution scheme. In AS2, Gold1 is
            available and it maps to color 101 TRDB.</t>

            <t>To facilitate this mapping, every SN/BN in all AS provision
            required transport classes viz. 100, 101 and 102. SN and BN in AS1
            and AS3 are provisioned with customized resolution schemes that
            resolve routes with transport-target:0:101 or
            transport-target:0:102 strictly over color 100 TRDB.</t>

            <t>PE31 is provisioned to originate BGP CT route with color 101
            for endpoint PE31. This route is sent with NLRI RD prefix RD1:PE31
            and route target extended community transport-target:0:101.</t>

            <t>At ASBR31, the route target "transport-target:0:101" on this
            BGP CT route instructs to add the route to color 101 TRDB. ASBR31
            is provisioned with customized resolution scheme that resolves the
            routes carrying mapping community transport-target:0:101 to
            resolve using color 100 TRDB. This route is then re-advertised
            from color 101 TRDB to ASBR22 with route-target:0:101.</t>

            <t>At ASBR22, the BGP CT routes received with
            transport-target:0:101 will be added to color 101 TRDB and
            strictly resolve over tunnel routes in the same TRDB. This route
            is re-advertised to ASBR21 with transport-target:0:101.</t>

            <t>Similarly, at ASBR21, the BGP CT routes received with
            transport-target:0:101 will be added to color 101 TRDB and
            strictly resolve over tunnel routes in the same TRDB. This route
            is re-advertised to ASBR11 with transport-target:0:101.</t>

            <t>At ASBR11, the route target "transport-target:0:101" on this
            BGP CT route instructs to add the route to color 101 TRDB. ASBR11
            is provisioned with a customized resolution scheme that resolves
            the routes carrying transport-target:0:101 to use color 100 TRDB.
            This route is then re-advertised from color 101 TRDB to PE11 with
            route-target:0:101.</t>

            <t>At PE11, the route target "transport-target:0:101" on this BGP
            CT route instructs to add the route to color 101 TRDB. PE11 is
            provisioned with a customized resolution scheme that resolves the
            routes carrying transport-target:0:101 to use color 100 TRDB.</t>

            <t>When PE11 receives the service route with the mapping community
            color:0:101 it directly resolves over the BGP CT route in color
            101 TRDB, which in turn resolves over tunnel routes in color 100
            TRDB.</t>

            <t>In doing so, PE11 can forward traffic via tunnels with color
            101, color 102 in the core domain, and color 100 in the metro
            domains.</t>

          <t>RD:PE11 BGP CT route is originated from PE11 towards ASBR11 with
          transport-target gold. ASBR11 readvertises this route with next hop
          set to ASBR11_lpbk_gold on the EBGP multihop session towards ASBR31.
          ASBR11 originates BGP LU route for endpoint ASBR11_lpbk_gold on EBGP
          session to ASBR21 with a 'gold SLA' community, and BGP LU route for
          ASBR11_lpbk_bronze with a 'bronze SLA' community. The SLA community
          is used by ASBR31 to publish the BGP LU routes in the corresponding
          BGP CT TRDBs.</t>

          <t>ASBR21 readvertises the BGP LU route for endpoint
          ASBR11_lpbk_gold to ASBR22 with next hop set by local policy config
          to the unique loopback ASBR21_lpbk_gold by matching the 'gold SLA'
          community received as part BGP LU advertisement from ASBR11. ASBR22
          receives this route and resolves the next hop over the
          ASBR22_to_ASBR21_lpbk_gold RSVP-TE tunnel. On successful resolution,
          ASBR22 readvertises this BGP LU route to ASBR31 with next hop self
          and a new label.</t>

          <t>ASBR31 adds the ASBR11_lpbk_gold route received via EBGP LU from
          ASBR22 to gold TRDB based on the received 'gold SLA' community.
          ASBR31 uses this gold TRDB route to resolve the next hop
          ASBR11_lpbk_gold received on BGP CT route with transport-target
          gold, for the prefix RD:PE11 received over the EBGP multihop CT
          session, thus preserving the end-to-end SLA. Now ASBR31 readvertises
          the BGP CT route for RD:PE11 with next hop as self thus stitching
          with the BGP LU LSP in AS2. Intradomain traffic forwarding in AS1
          and AS3 follows the procedures as explained in <xref
          target="CTProc">Illustration of CT Procedures</xref></t>

          <t>In cases where an SLA cannot be preserved in AS2 because SLA
          specific tunnels and loopbacks dont exist in AS2, traffic can be
          carried over available SLAs (eg: best-effort SLA) by rewriting the

            <t>This example shows a provider network with a mix of devices
            with different forwarding capabilities. R1 and R2 support
            forwarding both MPLS and SRv6 packets. R3 supports forwarding MPLS
            packets only. R4 supports forwarding SRv6 packets only. All these
            nodes have BGP session with Route Reflector RR1 which reflects
            routes between these nodes with next hop unchanged. BGP CT family
            is negotiated on these sessions.</t>

            <t>R1 and R2 send and receive both MPLS label and SRv6 SID in the
            BGP CT control plane routes. This allows them to be ingress and
            egress for both MPLS and SRv6 data planes. MPLS label is carried
            using RFC 8277 encoding, and SRv6 SID is carried using Prefix SID
            attribute as specified in <xref target="RFC9252"/>, without
            Transposition Scheme. The Transposition Length is set to 0 and
            Transposition Offset is set to 0 to indicate nothing is transposed
            and that the entire SRv6 SID value is encoded in the SID
            Information Sub-TLV. In this way, either MPLS or SRv6 forwarding
            can be used between R1 and R2.</t>

            <t>R1 and R3 send and receive MPLS label in the BGP CT control
            plane routes using RFC 8277 encoding. This allows them to be
            ingress and egress for MPLS data plane. R1 will carry SRv6 SID in
            Prefix-SID attribute, which will not be used by R3. In order to
            interoperate with MPLS only device R3, R1 MUST NOT use SRv6
            Transposition scheme described in <xref target="RFC9252"/>. The
            Transposition Length is set to 0 and Transposition Offset is set
            to 0 to indicate nothing is transposed and that the entire SRv6
            SID value is encoded in the SID Information Sub-TLV. MPLS
            forwarding will be used between R1 and R3.</t>

            <t>R1 and R4 send and receive SRv6 SID in the BGP CT control plane
            routes using BGP Prefix-SID attribute, without Transposition
            Scheme. This allows them to be ingress and egress for SRv6 data
            plane. R4 will carry the special MPLS Label with value 3
            (Implicit-NULL) in RFC 8277 encoding, which tells R1 not to push
            any MPLS label towards R4. The MPLS Label advertised by R1 in RFC
            8277 NLRI will not be used by R4. SRv6 forwarding will be used
            between R1 and R4.</t>

            <t>Note in this example that R3 and R4 cannot communicate directly
            with each other, because they don't support a common forwarding
            technology. The BGP CT routes received at R3, R4 from each other

            MPLS label is carried using RFC 8277 encoding. As specified in

            using TEA attribute (code 23) or the "barebones" Tunnel TLV
            carried in Encapsulation Extended Community. Either MPLS or UDP

            plane routes using RFC 8277 encoding. This allows them to be

            tunneling info in TEA attribute, which will not be used by R3.

            <t>R1 and R4 send and receive UDP tunneling info in the BGP CT

        <t>In the above table shown in <xref target="RDLabelVis"/>, both route
        churn and TE granularity are directly proportional to the number of CT
        labels received.</t>

        <t>Deploying unique RDs is strongly RECOMMENDED because it helps in
        troubleshooting by uniquely identifying the originator of a route and
        avoids path-hiding.</t>

        <t>The above table demonstrates that BGP CT allows an operator to
        control how much path visibility and forwarding diversity is desired
        in the network, for Unicast and Anycast endpoints.</t>

      <section title="Applicability to IPv6">
        <t>This section describes applicability of BGP CT to IPv6 at various
        layers. BGP CT procedures apply equally to an IPv6 enabled Intra-AS or
        Inter-AS Option A, B, C network.</t>

        <t>A BGP CT enabled network supports IPv6 service families (e.g.,
        AFI/SAFI 2/1 or 2/128) and IPv6 transport signaling protocols like
        SRTEv6, LDPv6, RSVP-TEv6.</t>

        <t>Procedures in this document also apply to a network with Pure IPv6
        core, that uses either MPLS forwarding or SRv6 forwarding for intra
        domain tunnels and inter-AS links. BGP CTv6 family (AFI/SAFI: 2/76) is
        used to carry global IPv6 address tunnel endpoints in the NLRI.
        Service family routes (e.g. AFI/SAFI: 1/1, 2/1, 1/128, 2/128) are also
        advertised with those Global IPv6 addresses as next hop.</t>

        <t>Procedures in this document also apply to a 6PE network with IPv4
        core, that uses MPLS forwarding for intra domain tunnels and Inter-AS
        links. BGP CTv6 family (AFI/SAFI: 2/76) is used to carry IPv4 Mapped
        IPv6 address tunnel endpoints in the NLRI. IPv6 Service family routes
        (e.g., AFI/SAFI: 2/1, 2/128) are also advertised with those IPv4
        Mapped IPv6 addresses as next hop.</t>

        <t>The PE-CE attachment circuits may use IPv4 addresses only, IPv6
        addresses only or both IPv4 and IPv6 addresses.</t>

    <section anchor="Security" title="Security Considerations">
      <t>This document defines a new BGP SAFI for AFIs 1 and 2 and therefore
      does not change the underlying security issues inherent in the existing
      BGP protocol, such as those described in <xref target="RFC4271"/> and
      <xref target="RFC4272"/>.</t>

      <t>Mechanisms described in this document follow a "Walled Garden"
      approach to carry routes for loopback addresses in BGP CT family
      (AFI/SAFI: 1/76 or 2/76), which is explicitly configured and negotiated
      between BGP speakers. This mitigates the risk of advertising internal
      loopback addresses outside the administrative control of the provider
      network. Further, procedures defined in <xref
      target="secure-propagate"/> mitigate the risk of unintented propagation
      of BGP CT routes across Inter-AS boundaries even when BGP CT family is
      negotiated on the EBGP session.</t>

      <t>Additionally, BGP sessions SHOULD be protected using TCP
      Authentication Option <xref target="RFC5925"/> and the Generalized TTL
      Security Mechanism <xref target="RFC5082"/>. To mitigate any risk of
      manipulating the routing information carried within a new SAFI, BGP
      origin validation <xref target="RFC6811"/> and BGPsec <xref
      target="RFC8205"/> could be used as means to increase assurance that the
      information has not been falsified.</t>

      <t>Using a separate BGP family and new RT (Transport Class RT) minimizes
      the possibility of these routes mixing with service routes.</t>

      <t>If redistributing between SAFI 76 and SAFI 4 routes for AFIs 1 or 2,
      there is a possibility of SAFI 4 routes mixing with SAFI 1 service
      routes. To avoid such scenarios, it is RECOMMENDED that implementations
      support keeping SAFI 76 and SAFI 4 transport routes in separate
      transport RIBs, distinct from service RIB that contain SAFI 1 service
      routes.</t>

      <t>BGP CT routes distribute label binding using <xref target="RFC8277"/>
      for MPLS dataplane and hence its security considerations apply.
      Moreover, in scenarios where MPLS is enabled on link to a device in an
      untrusted domain, e.g. a PE-CE link or ASBR-ASBR inter-AS link, security
      can be provided against MPLS label spoofing by using MPLS context tables
      as described in <xref target="MplsCE">MPLS enabled CE</xref>. Such that
      only MPLS traffic with labels advertised to the BGP speaker are allowed
      to forward. However, the PE may not be able to perform any checks based
      on inner payload in the MPLS packet since it performs label swap
      forwarding. Such 'inner payload' based checks may be offloaded to a
      downstream node that forwards and processes inner payload, e.g., an IP
      router having full FIB. These security aspects should be considered when
      using MPLS enabled CE devices.</t>

      <t>BGP CT routes distribute SRv6 SIDs for SRv6 dataplanes and hence
      security considerations of Section 9.3 of <xref target="RFC9252"/>
      apply. Moreover, SRv6 SID transposition scheme is disabled in BGP CT, as
      described in <xref target="CTMultiEncap"/>, to mitigate the risk of
      misinterpreting transposed SRv6 SID information as an MPLS label.</t>

      <t>As <xref target="RFC4272"/> discusses, BGP is vulnerable to
      traffic-diversion attacks. This SAFI routes adds a new means by which an
      attacker could cause the traffic to be diverted from its normal path.
      Potential consequences include "hijacking" of traffic (insertion of an
      undesired node in the path, which allows for inspection or modification
      of traffic, or avoidance of security controls) or denial of service
      (directing traffic to a node that doesn't desire to receive it).</t>

      <t>In order to mitigate the risk of the diversion of traffic from its
      intended destination, existing BGPsec solution could be extended and
      supported for this SAFI. The restriction of the applicability of this
      SAFI to its intended well-defined scope limits the likelihood of traffic
      diversions. Furthermore, as long as the filtering and appropriate
      configuration mechanisms discussed above are applied diligently, risk of
      the diversion of the traffic is eliminated.</t>

          <t>Such an indication can be in form of DSCP code point (<xref
          target="RFC2474"/>) in the IP header.</t>

          <t>In RFC2474, a Forwarding Class Selector maps to a PHB (Per-hop
          Behavior). The Transport Class construct is a PHB at transport
          layer.</t>

          <t>Let PE1 be configured to map DSCP1 to Gold Transport class, and
          DSCP2 to Bronze Transport class. Based on the DSCP code point
          received on the IP traffic from CE1, PE1 forwards the IP packet over
          a Gold or Bronze tunnel. Thus, the forwarding is not based on just
          the destination IP address, but also the DSCP code point. This is
          known as Class Based Forwarding (CBF). Today CBF is configured at
          the PE1 device roles and CE1 doesn't receive any indication in BGP
          signaling regarding what DSCP code points are being offered by the
          provider network.</t>

          <t>With a <xref target="MULTI-NH-ATTR">BGP MultiNexthop
          Attribute</xref> attached to a AFI/SAFI 1/1 service route, it is
          possible to extend the PE-CE BGP signalling (if used) to communicate

        <section anchor="MplsCE" title="MPLS-enabled CE">
          <t>If the PE-CE link is MPLS enabled, a distinct MPLS label can also
          be used to express Intent in data packets from CE. Enabling MPLS
          forwarding on PE-CE links comes with some security implications.
          This section gives details on these aspects.</t>

          <t>Consider the ingress PE1 receiving a VPN prefix RD:Pfx1 received
          with VPN label VL1, next hop as PE2 and a mapping community
          containing TC1 as 'Transport class ID'. PE1 can allocate a MPLS
          Label PVL1 for the tuple "VPN Label, PNH Address, Transport class
          ID" and advertise to CE1.</t>

          <t>Label PVL1 may identifies a service function at any node in the
          network, e.g. a Firewall device or egress node PE2. And, for the
          same service prefix, a distinct label may be advertised to different
          CEs, such that incoming traffic from different CEs to the same
          service prefix can be diverted to a distinct devices in the network
          for further processing. This provides Ingress Peer Engineering
          control to the network.</t>

          <t>PE1 installs a MPLS FIB route for PVL1 with next hop as "Swap
          VL1, Push TL1 towards PE2". TL1 is the BGP CT label received for the
          tuple 'PE2, TC1'. In forwarding, when MPLS packet with label PVL1 is
          received from CE1, PVL1 Swaps to label VL1 and pushes the BGP CT
          label TL1. PE1 advertises the label "PVL1" in the MULTI_NH_ATTR to
          CE1. PE1 forwards based on MPLS label without performing any IP
          lookup. This allows for PE1 to be a low IP FIB device and still
          support CBF by using MPLS Label inferred PHB. The number of MPLS
          Labels consumed at PE1 for this approach will be proportional to the
          number of Service functions and Intents that are exposed to CE1.</t>

          <t>A <xref target="MULTI-NH-ATTR">BGP MultiNexthop Attribute</xref>
          is attached to a AFI/SAFI 1/1 service route to convey the MPLS Label
          information to CE1. In the above example, the MNH contains two Next
          hop Legs, described by two Forwarding Instruction TLVs. Each Next
          hop Leg contains PE1's peering self address in <xref
          target="MNH-EP">Endpoint Identifier TLV</xref> , the color Gold or
          Bronze encoded in the <xref target="MNH-TC">Transport class ID
          TLV</xref> , and associated MPLS Label "PVL1" or "PVL2" encoded in
          the <xref target="MNH-ENCAP-MPLS">Payload Encapsulation Info
          TLV</xref> . This allows the CE to discover what transport classes
          exist in the provider network, and which MPLS Label to encode so
          that traffic is forwarded using the desired transport class.</t>

          <section title="Secure MPLS Forwarding on Inter-AS Link">
            <t>The MPLS enabled PE-CE attachment circuit is considered
            connecting to an untrusted domain. Such interfaces can be secured
            against MPLS label spoofing by a walled garden approach using
            "MPLS context tables".</t>

            <t>The PE1-CE1 interface can be confined to a specific MPLS
            context table "A" corresponding to the BGP peer. Such that only
            the routes for labels advertised to CE1 are installed in MPLS
            context table "A".</t>

            <t>This ensures that if CE1 sends MPLS packet with a label that
            was not advertised to the CE1, the packet will be dropped.</t>

            <t>Further, the routes for labels PVL1, PVL2 installed in MPLS
            context table "A" can match on 'Bottom of stack' bit being 'one',
            ensuring a MPLS packet is accepted from CE1 only if it has no more
            than one label in the label stack.</t>

            <t>However, the PE itself may not be able to perform any checks
            based on inner payload in the MPLS packet since it performs label
            swap forwarding. Such inner payload based checks may be offloaded
            to a downstream node that forwards and processes inner payload,
            e.g. a IP FIB router. These security aspects should be considered
            when using MPLS enabled CE devices.</t>

          <t>Service nodes PE11, ASBR12 negotiate service family (AFI/SAFI
          1/128) on the BGP session with RR13. Service helper RR13 reflects
          service routes between the PE11 and ASBR12 with next hop
          unchanged.</t>

          <t>Similarly, in AS2 PE22, ASBR21 negotiate service family (AFI/SAFI
          1/128) on the BGP session with RR23, which reflects service routes
          between the PE22 and ASBR21 with next hop unchanged.</t>

          <t>ASBR21 and ASBR12 negotiate AFI/SAFI 1/128 between them, and
          readvertise L3VPN routes with next hop self, allocating new labels.
          EBGP session peering on interface address.</t>

          <t>CE41 advertises a route for example prefix 203.0.113.41 with next
          hop self to PE22 VRF. CE41 can attach a Mapping Community
          Color:0:100 on this route, to indicate its request for Gold SLA. Or,
          PE22 can attach the same using locally configured policies.</t>

          <t>Consider, CE41 is getting VPN service from PE22. The
          RD:203.0.113.41 route is readvertised in AFI/SAFI 1/128 by PE22 with
          next hop self (192.0.2.22) and label V-L1, to RR23 with the Mapping
          Community Color:0:100 attached. This AFI/SAFI 1/128 route reaches
          ASBR21 via RR23 with the next hop unchanged as PE22 and label V-L1.
          Now ASBR21 can resolve the PNH 192.0.2.22 using ASBR21_to_PE22_gold
          SRTE LSP.</t>

          <t>Next, ASBR21 readvertises the RD:203.0.113.41 route with next hop
          self to ASBR12, with a newly allocated MPLS label, V-L2. Forwarding
          for this label is installed to Swap V-L1, and Push labels for
          ASBR21_to_PE22_gold tunnel.</t>

          <t>ASBR12 further readvertises the RD:203.0.113.41 route via RR13 to
          PE11 with next hop self 192.0.2.12. PE11 resolves the next hop
          192.0.2.12 over PE11_to_ASBR12_gold RSVP TE tunnel.</t>

          <t>Traffic traverses as IP packet on the following legs: CE31-PE11,

          inside AS1, AS2 core.</t>

          <t>BGP CT AFI/SAFI 1/76 is not used in this Inter-AS Option B

    <section anchor="Appendix C" numbered="true"
             title="Why reuse RFC 8277 and RFC 4364?">
      <t>RFC 4364 is one of the key design patterns produced by networking
      industry. It introduced virtualization and allowed sharing of resources
      in service provider space with multiple tenant networks, providing
      isolated and secure Layer3 VPN services. This design pattern has been
      reused since to provide other service layer virtualizations like Layer2
      virtualization (VPLS, L2VPN, EVPN), ISO virtualization, ATM
      virtualization, Flowspec VPN.</t>

      <t>It is to be noted that these services have different NLRI encoding.
      L3VPN Service family that binds MPLS label to an IP prefix use RFC 8277
      encoding, and others define different NLRI encodings.</t>

      <t>BGP CT reuses RFC 4364 procedures to slice a transport network into
      multiple transport planes that different service routes can bind to,
      using color.</t>

      <t>BGP CT reuses RFC 8277 because it precisely fits the purpose. viz. In
      a MPLS network, BGP CT needs to bind MPLS label for transport endpoints
      which are IPv4 or IPv6 endpoints, and disambiguate between multiple
      instances of those endpoints in multiple transport planes. Hence, use of
      RD:IP_Prefix and carrying a Label for it as specified in RFC 8277 works
      well for this purpose.</t>

      <t>Another advantage of using the precise encoding as defined in RFC
      4364 and RFC 8277 is that it allows to interoperate with BGP speakers
      that support SAFI 128 for AFIs 1 or 2. This can be useful during
      transition, until all BGP speakers in the network support BGP CT.</t>

      <t>In future, if RFC 8277 evolves into a typed NLRI, that does not carry
      Label in the NLRI, BGP CT will be compatible with that as-well. In
      essence, BGP CT encoding is compatible with existing deployed
      technologies (RFC 4364, RFC 8277) and will adapt to any changes RFC 8277
      mechanisms undergo in future.</t>

      <t>This is a more pragmatic approach which leverages the benefits of
      time tested design patterns proposed in RFC 4364 and RFC 8277. Moreover,
      this approach greatly reduces operational training costs and protocol
      compatibility considerations, as it complements and works well with
      existing protocol machineries. This problem does not need reinventing
      the wheel with brand new NLRI and procedures.</t>

      <t>This is a more pragmatic approach, rather than abandoning time tested
      design pattern like RFC 4364 and RFC 8277, just to invent something
      completely new that is not backward compatible with existing
      deployments. Overloading RFC 8277 NLRI MPLS Label field with information
      related to non MPLS data plane leads to backward compatibility
      issues.</t>

      <section numbered="true" title="Update packing considerations">
        <t>BGP CT carries transport class as an attribute. This means routes
        that don't share the same transport class cannot be packed into same
        Update message. Update packing in BGP CT will be similar to RFC 8277
        family routes carrying attributes like communities or extended
        communities. Service families like AFI/SAFI 1/128 have considerably
        more scale than transport families like AFI/SAFI 1/4 or AFI/SAFI 1/76,
        which carry only loopbacks. Update packing mechanisms that scale for
        AFI/SAFI 1/128 routes will scale similarly for AFI/SAFI 1/76 routes
        also.</t>

        <t>The document <xref target="Intent-Routing-Color">Intent-aware
        Routing using Color </xref> Section 6.3.2.1 suggests scaling numbers
        for transport network where BGP CT can be deployed. Experiments were
        conducted with this scale to find the convergence time with BGP CT for
        those scaling numbers. Scenarios involving BGP CT carrying IPv4 and
        IPv6 endpoints with MPLS label, and IPv6 endpoints with SRv6 SID were
        tested.</t>

        <t>Tests were conducted with 1.9 million BGP CT route scale (387K
        endpoints in 5 transport classes). Initial convergence time for all
        cases was less than 2 minutes, This experiment proves that carrying
        transport class information as an attribute keeps BGP convergence
        within acceptable range. Details of the experiment and test results
        are available in <xref target="BGP-CT-UPDATE-PACKING-TEST">BGP CT
        Update packing Test Results </xref>.</t>

        <t>Further, even in today's BGP LU deployments each egress node
        originates BGP LU route for it's loopback, with some attributes like
        community identifying the originating node or region, and AIGP
        attribute. These attributes may be unique per egress node, thus do not
        help with update packing in transport layer family routes.</t>

    <section anchor="Appendix D" numbered="true"
             title="Scaling using BGP MPLS Namespaces">
      <t>This section describes how scaling is achieved in an Inter domain
      MPLS network, where a domain is an AS or IGP area. Domain boundary is
      demarcated by a BN performing BGP next hop self action on the transport
      route.</t>

      <t>It considers the scenario suggested in the document <xref
      target="Intent-Routing-Color">Intent-aware Routing using Color </xref>
      Section 6.3.2.1. where 300K nodes exist in the network with 5 transport
      classes.</t>

      <t>This may result in 1.5M transport layer routes and MPLS transit
      routes in all Border Nodes in the network, which may overwhelm the
      nodes' MPLS forwarding resources.</t>

      <t>This section explains how mechanism described in <xref
      target="MPLS-NAMESPACES"/> is used to scale such a network. This
      approach reduces the number of PNHs that are globally visible in the
      network, thus reducing forwarding resource usage network wide. Service
      route state is kept confined closer to network edge, and any churn is
      confined within the region containing the point of failure, which
      improves convergence.</t>

      <t>In order to achieve these scaling benefits, new functionality is
      required only at a Region's Border Nodes and the Regional RRs. All other
      nodes can remain legacy nodes, and still get the scaling and convergence
      benefits of this mechanism. This is mainly advantageous to ingress and
      egress PE devices which may be low end devices not capable of pushing
      deep label stacks or supporting large number of ECMP next hops. They can
      enjoy the scaling benefits without needing software upgrades.</t>

      <section numbered="true" title="Illustration.">
        <t>Let us consider the decomposition of this example network with 300K
        nodes to be such that there are 300 domains containing 1000 nodes
        each. The mechanism described here will reduce the forwarding resource
        usage in all Border Nodes to become a function of number of domains
        (300) instead of number of nodes (300K). Thus, drastically reducing
        MPLS transit routes from 1.5M to 1500. The Border Nodes and Regional
        RRs in a Region do the job of abstracting the 1000 PE loopbacks from
        the rest of the network. The rest of the network sees this region as 1
        BGP next hop, and not as 1000 BGP next hops.</t>

        <t>L3VPN Service routes are present only at ingress and egress PEs.
        L3VPN family (AFI/SAFI 1/128) is negotiated between PE11..PE11000 and
        regional route reflector RR11. RR11 has multihop EBGP peering with
        RR31 and negotiates AFI/SAFI 1/128. RR31 further peers with all PEs
        PE31..PE31000 in Domain3.</t>

        <t>At the Transport layer - in Domain1, PE11..PE11000 negotiate BGP
        families (AFI/SAFI 1/4, AFI/SAFI 1/76) with BN11, BN12. In Domain2,
        BN11 and BN12 similarly negotiate the transport families with BN21,
        which in turn peers with BN31 and BN32. In Domain3, BN31 and BN32 peer
        with PEs PE31..PE31000. Each of these BNs change BGP next hop to self,
        when re advertising the AFI/SAFI 1/4, AFI/SAFI 1/76 transport

      <section anchor="CPNH" title="Context Protocol Nexthop Address (CPNH)">
        <t>A MPLS Namespace is identified by a Context PNH address. In MPLS
        forwarding, labels are locally significant to the node advertising it.
        E.g. labels in default/global MPLS Namespace are scoped by the node's
        loopback address. The labels belonging to a MPLS Namespace are locally
        significant in scope of the Context PNH address.</t>

        <t>A UHP label called as "Context Label" is advertised for the CPNH in
        a transport protocol, which points to the MPLS Namespace forwarding
        context. When Context label is received as outer label in a MPLS
        packet, it is Popped, and lookup is performed for the MPLS label that
        appears in the MPLS Namespace identified by the CPNH.</t>

        <t>In this example, CPNH is an anycast IP address that represents set
        of PEs in a domain. E.g. CPNH1 represent all PEs in Domain1. And CPNH3
        represents all PEs in Domain3.</t>
      </section>

      <section title="Service Forwarding Helper, and Changes to Transport Layer.">
        <t>The border nodes BN11, BN12 maintain the forwarding context for
        MPLS Namespace identified by CPNH1. They advertise CPNH1 in transport
        layer routes like AFI/SAFI 1/4 or AFI/SAFI 1/76 with a UHP Context
        Label CL1. Any transport layer protocol may be used to advertise the
        UHP Context Label for the CPNH.</t>

        <t>In this way, BN11 and BN12 serve as Service Forwarding Helpers for
        CPNH1 MPLS Namespace. They attract traffic that remote devices send
        towards the BGP next hop CPNH1, and forward the MPLS packets received
        with the MPLS labels belonging to the MPLS Namespace identified by
        CPNH1.</t>

        <t>The individual loopback addresses of the PEs need not be advertised
        outside the local region. E.g. PE11..PE11000 are not advertised beyond
        BN11, BN12. Only CPNH1 and RR11 addresses are advertised out. RR1 is
        used for the control plane peering and CPNH1 is used as a forwarding
        anchor point.</t>

        <t>Similarly, Domain3 advertises only RR31 and CPNH3 to Domain2. This
        significantly reduces the transport route scale and MPLS forwarding
        resource usage at the border nodes throughout the network.</t>
      </section>

      <section title="BGP MPLS Namespace Address family (AFI:16399, SAFI:128)">
        <t>In Domain1, the regional route reflector RR11 negotiates MPLS
        Namespace Signaling address family with the border nodes BN11, BN12.
        RR11 is an external label allocator for the MPLS Namespace identified
        by CPNH1. RR1 advertises in the MPLS Namespace address family, the
        labels it allocated in scope of CPNH1. These routes are advertised
        with a route target that identifies CPNH1. BN11 and BN12 use this
        route target to import the label route into the forwarding context
        associated with CPNH1.</t>

        <t>Similarly, in Domain3, RR31 negotiates MPLS Namespace Signaling
        address family with the border nodes BN31, BN32.</t>
      </section>

      <section title="Changes to Service Layer Route Exchange">
        <t>When RR11 re-advertises to RR31 a VPN route RD:Pfx1 received with
        label VL1 from egress PE11 in Domain1, it sets BGP next hop to CPNH1,
        and advertises a new label PL1. This label PL1 is allocated within the
        scope of CPNH1 namespace.</t>

        <t>The label PL1 is advertised to BN1, BN2 in MPLS Namespace address
        family with a route target identifying CPNH1, and BGP next hop PE11
        and label VL1 that were received from the egress PE. BN1 and BN2
        resolve the path to that BGP next hop PE11 and use as next hop for the
        PL1 route installed in CPNH1 forwarding context.</t>

        <t>The remote PEs in Domain3 consume the BGP updates from Domain1
        following regular procedures for AFI/SAFI 1/128. When resolving the
        BGP next hop CPNH1, they will push the context label that lands the
        traffic into the correct forwarding context in one of the border
        nodes.</t>
      </section>

      <section title="Analysis of Forwarding Behavior">
        <t>The forwarding behavior thus achieved is similar to Inter-AS Option
        B, without carrying any service routes at the border nodes. Further,
        the MPLS namespace labels are installed in all the border nodes, which
        allows for quicker traffic convergence in case of border node failure.
        The number of border nodes can be increased in a scale out manner,
        which gives a cookie cutter template to scale a network region.</t>

        <t>In conclusion, this mechanism provides both scaling and convergence
        benefits for the MPLS network, and allows to support huge scale
        networks.</t>

        advertisements in this example carry a MPLS label value of 3 (Implicit
        Null) in the NLRI encoding.</t>

        <t>Reachability between PE1 and PE2 is formed using BGP CT family.
        Service families like IPv4 unicast (AFI: 1, SAFI: 1) and L3VPN (AFI:
        2, SAFI: 128) is negotiated on multihop EBGP session between PE1 and
        PE2. These service routes carry service SID to identify service
        functions at the advertising PE, and mapping community to identify the
        desired Intent.</t>

            <t>ASBR1-SRv6-gold : ASBR1 End SID from ASBR1-SRv6-gold-loc, for

            <t>ASBR1-SRv6-PE2-gold-Replace : at ASBR1 End.REPLACE SID for PE2,

            PE2, bronze transport class.</t>
          </list></t>

        <t>Architecturally, the forwarding semantic of End.REPLACE SID
        operation is similar to Label SWAP operation in MPLS data plane. When
        a route received with End SID (e.g. PE2-SRv6-gold or PE2-SRv6-bronze
        transport SIDs) is readvertised with next hop self, a IPv6 forwarding
        entry is emitted with a forwarding semantic of End.B6.Encaps
        operation, which means: Update IPv6 DA with Next Segment in SRH, and
        Encapsulate SRv6 SID corresponding to the correct transport class.
        This can be seen in IPv6 FIB of ASBR2 during "BGP CT processing at
        ASBR2" in the following illustration:</t>

        <t>The following service layer SRv6 End.DT4 SIDs are provisioned:<list>

        <t>The locators for above provisioned SRv6 SIDs will be advertised via

        <t>Firstly, PE2 originates BGP CT route for its transport layer

        <t>When ASBR2 receives the IBGP CT advertisement for gold route from

        <t>The operational, scaling and convergence aspects of this approach
        are similar to the aspects of applying BGP CT procedures to the MPLS
        data plane.</t>
      </section>

      <section title="Color-encoded Service SID (CPR) Approach">
        <t>CPR is defined in the document: <xref
        target="Colorful-Prefix-Routing-SRv6">Colorful Prefix Routing for SRv6
        based services </xref>, and uses IPv6 Unicast (AFI/SAFI = 2/1) as a
        transport family. CPR mechanism does not use BGP CT (AFI/SAFI 2/76)
        address family.</t>

        <t>CPR uses color encoded SRv6 service SIDs to determine the
        intent-aware transport paths for the service, without a separate
        transport SRv6 SID. It routes using "Colorful Prefix" locators in the
        transport layer, which are carried in the IPv6 Unicast BGP family.</t>

        <t>A Next hop Resolution Scheme similar to that of BGP CT <xref
        target="Nexthop_Resoln_Schm"/> is used on IPv6 Unicast family to
        resolve &ldquo;Colorful Prefix&rdquo; locator routes that carry a
        mapping community to intent-aware paths in each domain.</t>

        <t>By virtue of the CPR SID allocation scheme, the service SIDs
        inherit the Intent of the corresponding Colorful Prefix route just by
        performing longest prefix match in forwarding plane.</t>

        <section title="Analysis of CPR Approach">
          <t>The CPR approach can be used to support intent driven routing
          while minimizing SRv6 encapsulation overhead, at the cost of careful
          SID numbering and planning. The state in the transport network is a
          function of total number of Colorful Prefixes.</t>

          <t>In the CPR approach, typically one service SID is allocated for
          each service function (e.g. VRF) which is associated with a specific
          intent. In some special scenarios, for example, when different
          service routes in the same VRF are with different intents, a unique
          service SID would need to be allocated for each intent associated
          with the VRF.</t>

          <t>However, the CPR mechanism preserves BGP PIC (Prefix scale
          Independent Convergence) for the egress SN failure scenario where
          only Colorful Prefix routes need to be withdrawn.</t>

          <t>CPR achieves strict Intent based forwarding for the service
          routes. Fallback to best effort transport class is achieved by
          numbering all SRv6 Colorful Prefix locators at the egress SN to fall
          in the same subnet as the SRv6 locator that uses best effort
          transport class. Customized intent fallback between different color
          transport classes may be achieved by allocating a CPR prefix for
          each such intent fallback policy, and advertising that CPR prefix
          with an appropriate mapping community, that maps to a customized
          resolution scheme. Alternatively, the intent fallback policy may be
          provisioned on the ingress nodes directly.</t>

          <t>Further, IPv6 Unicast family is widely deployed to carry Internet
          Service routes. Repurposing IPv6 Unicast family to carry Transport
          routes also may impact the operational complexity and security
          aspects in the network.</t>
